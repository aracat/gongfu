This is a very low effort Gong Fu tea preparation timer.

Go to the github pages site for it: https://aracat.github.io/gongfu/

Tell it how long the first steeping is and how much longer each successive steeping will be, then push the button.

Push Begin or press the space bar to start the timer. It will count down and then beep a few times when the timer is up. Push the other buttons to go back a step or skip a step.
